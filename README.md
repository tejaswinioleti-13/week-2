# 🍎 Fruit Freshness Detection (Week 2)

### 👩‍💻 Author: Tejaswini Oleti  
### 📅 Week 2 Milestone — Model Training and Accuracy Visualization  

---

## 📘 Overview
This week’s milestone focuses on *training and testing a CNN model* to classify fruits as fresh or rotten using the smaller Kaggle dataset (≈ 1,500 images across 6 classes).  

The goal is to improve sustainability by detecting fruit quality automatically.
